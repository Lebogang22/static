Social Doner is a not-for-profit organisation; therefore, ownership of its assets does not vest in its members. In the event that SANBS should stop operating, its assets would have to be transferred to an organisation with similar goals and objectives.

SANBS provides an essential service within South Africa and is rated amongst the best in the world in the provision of blood and blood products, as well as in relation to the research and training provided.

SANBS operates across all of South Africa, with the exclusion of the Western Cape.

SANBS is further regarded as a major role player in the provision of support to countries in the SADC region.
